				<br>
				Linguine: The wider noodles really capture the sauce and stand up to the crispy chicken well. You can use other pastas if that's what you have on hand; more on that below.
				<br>
				<br>
				All-purpose flour: Flour on the chicken cutlets will help the egg wash and panko breadcrumbs adhere to the meat for the best crispy coating.
				Panko: This type of breadcrumb stays crispy and cooks up beautifully in a pan fry.
				<br>
				<br>
				Italian seasoning: Add some to the panko, along with salt, pepper, and lemon zest for a quick seasoning.
				<br>
				<br>
				Salt and pepper: To season the panko and chicken.
				Lemons: You'll need a few lemons because you need both zest and juice for this dish.
				<br>
				<br>
				Egg: For the egg wash. It helps the panko mixture stick to the chicken cutlets.
				<br>
				<br>
				Chicken: Having chicken breasts the right size is key to cooking them fast. You can substitute with chicken breast cutlets or chicken tenders if cutting in half lengthwise seems tedious or you need to speed up the prep.
				<br>
				<br>
				Olive oil: For frying the zucchini and chicken.
				<br>
				<br>
				Zucchini: Cut rounds that are even in thickness.
				<br>
				<br>
				Unsalted butter: The fat used to start the rich cream sauce.
				<br>
				<br>
				Garlic and onion powder: These build up the flavor of the cream sauce.
				<br>
				<br>
				Heavy whipping cream: The bulk to the sauce with richness and a delicate sweetness that's blunted by the lemon and cheese.
				<br>
				<br>
				Parmesan cheese: We like the nutty flavor of this cheese, and it's easy to find. In fact, we recommend you grate your own instead of buying the pre-shredded or pre-grated kind. These often have anti-caking agents that keep the cheese from melting beautifully.
				<br>
				<br>
				Parsley and lemon slices: For garnishing the finished dish.
				<td> 
				<br>
				Step 1 Cook the pasta. Reserve some of the cooking liquid for the pasta sauce later.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 2 Dredge the chicken. First, coat each piece in flour. Then, dip in the egg, followed by the panko mixture. When each piece is coated, it's time to cook them.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 3 Brown the zucchini. While you're dredging chicken, brown the zucchini rounds in batches in a skillet.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 4 Cook the chicken. Once the zucchini is finished, cook the chicken, working in batches. Each piece is done when the internal temperature reaches 165Â°F.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 5 Make the pasta sauce. In the same pot you cooked the pasta, melt butter. Cook the garlic and onion powder. Then, add the whipping cream and reserved pasta cooking water. Simmer until slightly thickened, and reduce heat to low. Whisk continuously while adding the lemon juice, followed by the Parmesan cheese. Cook until the sauce is thick.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 6 Add the pasta to sauce, along with the zucchini and lemon zest.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 7 Slice the chicken, and serve with some of the pasta and a garnish of parsley and lemon slices.
