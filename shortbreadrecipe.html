				<td>
				2 cups all-purpose flour
				<br>
				<br>

				½ cup almond meal
				<br>
				<br>

				¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
				<br>
				<br>

				1 teaspoon kosher salt
				<br>
				<br>

				1 ½ cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for baking sheet
				<br>
				<br>

				¼ cup granulated sugar
				<br>
				<br>

				¾ cup cold apricot preserves (from a 10-oz. jar)
				<br>
				<br>

				½ cup heavy whipping cream
				<br>
				<br>

				6 ounces cream cheese (from an 8-oz.pkg.), at room temperature
				<br>
				<br>

				3 cups marshmallow fluff (from a 16-oz. jar), divided
				<br>
				<br>

				11 ½ ounces milk chocolate chips (1¾ cups)
				<br>
				<br>

				3 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil
				<br>
				<br>

				½ cup sliced almonds, toasted and roughly chopped
				<td> 
				<br>
				Step 1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly coat a large, rimmed baking sheet with butter. Line with parchment paper; lightly coat with butter. Whisk flour, almond meal, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low; add flour mixture, beating until just combined and a soft dough forms, about 1 minute. Place dough on prepared baking sheet and press into an 11-by-10-inch rectangle. Bake until shortbread is set, dried on top, and slightly darkened around edges, about 30 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack; let cool completely, about 45 minutes. (Shortbread may be stored, loosely covered in plastic wrap, at room temperature for up to 1 day.)
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 2 Spread preserves over shortbread to reach edges. Beat whipping cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Beat cream cheese and 1 cup fluff in a separate large bowl on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add remaining 2 cups fluff and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Fold in whipped cream until combined. Spoon over preserves on shortbread, leaving a 1-inch border around edges. Chill, uncovered, until firm enough to slice, at least 3 hours and up to 12 hours.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 3 Place chocolate chips and oil in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high, stirring halfway through, until mostly melted, about 1 minute. Stir until smooth. (Or melt on stove.) Let stand, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
				<br>
				<br>

				Step 4 Using a sharp chef’s knife, cut marshmallow shortbread into 12 rectangles on baking sheet. Spoon melted chocolate over slices and top with almonds.
